# Installation Guide

This guide walks you through setting up DocX on your local machine for development and testing. Ensure your system meets the following prerequisites

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- Have the latest versions of npm and Node.js installed.
- Compatible with Windows, Linux, or macOS.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and clone the DocX repository using this command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/projectname.git
```

### 2. Move into the Project Directory

``` bash
cd projectname
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Use npm to install necessary project dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Set Up the .env File

Create a `.env` file in your root folder and add the following keys

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
PW=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=

# Stripe Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

### 5. Configuring the Database

1. **Register for a Supabase Account**

Sign up for a Supabase account at [Supabase](https://supabase.com) if you don't have one yet.

2. **Create a Project**

- Log in and create a new project, providing project details such as the project name and the closest region (e.g., "south-asia").
- Before creating the project, ensure you paste the project password into the `.env` file under the `PW` section.

3. **Retrieve Keys from Supabase**

    After project creation, gather the required security keys:

    - **Anonymous Key**: Access your project page in Supabase and locate the anon key. Paste it into the `.env` file at `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
    - **Service Role Key**: In your Supabase project settings, reveal the service role key. Copy and paste it into the `.env` file at `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

4. **Database URL and Host**

    Copy the URL and host information from your Supabase project:

    - **Database URL**: Paste the URL into the `.env` file at `DATABASE_URL`.
    - **Host**: Copy the host information and paste it into the `.env` file at `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`.

5. **Set Site URL**

    Ensure that the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in the `.env` file is configured to `http://localhost:3000/`. This local URL is crucial for the project to operate correctly.

    ```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000/
    ```

**NOTE : Retrieve Lost Keys**

    In case of missing security keys:

    Go to the "Settings" tab and navigate to the "Database" section in the Supabase dashboard. You'll find all the necessary security keys there.
